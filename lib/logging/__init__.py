# Pystachy port of CPython 3.13.16's Lib/logging/__init__.py (lib/provenance.md). The module opts
# in to dynamic Any (the comment above): a record's message and arguments, a level's name and the
# values a format interpolates have whatever types its caller gives. %-style messages and formats
# are formatted by _pystachy_percent, as % formats a format string known only at run time. There
# are no frames, so a record's caller is CPython's unknown one ("(unknown file)", 0,
# "(unknown function)"), and no tracebacks (lib/traceback.py). Each change is marked "Pystachy
# port"; lib/compatibility.md#logging lists the limits.

    Formatter instances are used to convert a LogRecord to text.

    Formatters need to know how a LogRecord is constructed. They are
    responsible for converting a LogRecord to (usually) a string which can
    be interpreted by either a human or an external system. The base Formatter
    allows a formatting string to be specified. If none is supplied, the
    style-dependent default value, "%(message)s", "{message}", or
    "${message}", is used.

    The Formatter can be initialized with a format string which makes use of
    knowledge of the LogRecord attributes - e.g. the default value mentioned
    above makes use of the fact that the user's message and arguments are pre-
    formatted into a LogRecord's message attribute. Currently, the useful
    attributes in a LogRecord are described by:

    %(name)s            Name of the logger (logging channel)
    %(levelno)s         Numeric logging level for the message (DEBUG, INFO,
                        WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL)
    %(levelname)s       Text logging level for the message ("DEBUG", "INFO",
                        "WARNING", "ERROR", "CRITICAL")
    %(pathname)s        Full pathname of the source file where the logging
                        call was issued (if available)
    %(filename)s        Filename portion of pathname
    %(module)s          Module (name portion of filename)
    %(lineno)d          Source line number where the logging call was issued
                        (if available)
    %(funcName)s        Function name
    %(created)f         Time when the LogRecord was created (time.time_ns() / 1e9
                        return value)
    %(asctime)s         Textual time when the LogRecord was created
    %(msecs)d           Millisecond portion of the creation time
    %(relativeCreated)d Time in milliseconds when the LogRecord was created,
                        relative to the time the logging module was loaded
                        (typically at application startup time)
    %(thread)d          Thread ID (if available)
    %(threadName)s      Thread name (if available)
    %(taskName)s        Task name (if available)
    %(process)d         Process ID (if available)
    %(processName)s     Process name (if available)

    Instances of the Logger class represent a single logging channel. A

    "area" is defined is up to the application developer. Since an
    application can have any number of areas, logging channels are identified
    by a unique string. Application areas can be nested (e.g. an area
    of "input processing" might include sub-areas "read CSV files", "read
    XLS files" and "read Gnumeric files"). To cater for this natural nesting,
    channel names are organized into a namespace hierarchy where levels are
    separated by periods, much like the Java or Python package namespace. So
    in the instance given above, channel names might be "input" for the upper
    level, and "input.csv", "input.xls" and "input.gnu" for the sub-levels.

    Do basic configuration for the logging system.

    This function does nothing if the root logger already has handlers
    configured, unless the keyword argument *force* is set to ``True``.
    It is a convenience method intended for use by simple scripts
    to do one-shot configuration of the logging package.

    The default behaviour is to create a StreamHandler which writes to
    sys.stderr, set a formatter using the BASIC_FORMAT format string, and
    add the handler to the root logger.

    A number of optional keyword arguments may be specified, which can alter
    the default behaviour.

    filename  Specifies that a FileHandler be created, using the specified
              filename, rather than a StreamHandler.
    filemode  Specifies the mode to open the file, if filename is specified
              (if filemode is unspecified, it defaults to 'a').
    format    Use the specified format string for the handler.
    datefmt   Use the specified date/time format.
    style     If a format string is specified, use this to specify the
              type of format string (possible values '%', '{', '$', for
              %-formatting, :meth:`str.format` and :class:`string.Template`
              - defaults to '%').
    level     Set the root logger level to the specified level.
    stream    Use the specified stream to initialize the StreamHandler. Note
              that this argument is incompatible with 'filename' - if both
              are present, 'stream' is ignored.
    handlers  If specified, this should be an iterable of already created
              handlers, which will be added to the root logger. Any handler
              in the list which does not have a formatter assigned will be
              assigned the formatter created in this function.
    force     If this keyword  is specified as true, any existing handlers
              attached to the root logger are removed and closed, before
              carrying out the configuration as specified by the other
              arguments.
    encoding  If specified together with a filename, this encoding is passed to
              the created FileHandler, causing it to be used when the file is
              opened.
    errors    If specified together with a filename, this value is passed to the
              created FileHandler, causing it to be used when the file is
              opened in text mode. If not specified, the default value is
              `backslashreplace`.

    Note that you could specify a stream created using open(filename, mode)
    rather than passing the filename and mode in. However, it should be
    remembered that StreamHandler does not close its stream (since it may be
    using sys.stdout or sys.stderr), whereas FileHandler closes its stream
    when the handler is closed.

    .. versionchanged:: 3.3
       Added the ``handlers`` parameter. A ``ValueError`` is now thrown for
       incompatible arguments (e.g. ``handlers`` specified together with
       ``filename``/``filemode``, or ``filename``/``filemode`` specified
       together with ``stream``, or ``handlers`` specified together with
       ``stream``.

    .. versionchanged:: 3.8
       Added the ``force`` parameter.

    .. versionchanged:: 3.9
       Added the ``encoding`` and ``errors`` parameters.
